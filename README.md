# Backpropagation
## Session 2 - Backpropagation, embeddings & Language Models
- Rewrite the whole excel sheet showing back-propagation. Explain each major step, and write it on Github.
- Use exactly the same values for all variables as used in the class
- Take a screenshot, and show that screenshot in the readme file
- Excel file must be there for us to cross-check the image shown on readme (no image = no score)
- Explain each major step
- Show what happens to the error graph when you change the learning rate from [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0]
- Submit the GitHub link. Github link must be public (check the link without logging in, if it opens, then only share the link as an assignment).
